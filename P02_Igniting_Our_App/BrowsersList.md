# 🌐 Browserslist in Frontend Projects

Browserslist is a configuration tool used by frontend build systems like Babel, Autoprefixer, ESLint, Parcel, and Webpack to determine which browsers your code should support.  

By defining a Browserslist in your project, you make sure your JavaScript and CSS are transpiled and optimized for the right audience.

## 🔹 Where to Define Browserslist

You can declare it in different places such as:  
- Inside package.json under the browserslist field  
- In a separate .browserslistrc file  
- As part of other configuration files (for example babel.config.js)  

## 🔹 Example in `package.json`

```json
{
  "browserslist": [
    ">0.2%",
    "not dead",
    "not op_mini all"
  ]
}
```

---

## 🔹 How It Works

Browserslist uses queries to decide which browsers to support. Some examples:  

- >0.2% → Supports browsers with more than 0.2% global usage  
- not dead → Excludes browsers that no longer receive updates  
- not op_mini all → Excludes Opera Mini, which lacks modern features  
- last 2 versions → Supports the last two releases of every browser  
- defaults → Uses Browserslist’s default recommended set of browsers  
- ie 11 → Explicitly includes Internet Explorer 11

## 🔹 Why It Matters

- **Babel**: Transpiles modern JavaScript so it runs on older browsers  
- **Autoprefixer**: Adds missing CSS vendor prefixes  
- **Parcel/Webpack**: Optimizes the final bundle based on your target browsers  

Without a Browserslist, your app may break on older browsers or ship unnecessary polyfills to modern ones.

## 🔹 Best Practices

A good practice is to use a balanced configuration that ensures modern support while keeping bundle sizes small. For example, many projects use:  

- Browsers with more than 0.5% usage  
- The last two versions of each major browser  
- Excluding browsers that are “dead” (no updates for over 2 years)

```json
{
  "browserslist": [
    ">0.5%",
    "last 2 versions",
    "not dead"
  ]
}
```

✨ With Browserslist, you are in control of which browsers can run your app, ensuring the right balance between modern features, performance, and compatibility.
